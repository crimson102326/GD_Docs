## Project manager
Hi friend, I hope you're doing well.
My name is José, and I'm the COO at Laqus, a Brazil-based venture building secure and accessible web3 products.

We're currently gearing up to launch ScaleIn, our flagship NFT marketplace designed to empower creators and collectors with transparent royalties, scalable infrastructure, and a strong presence in the global market.

Now we're assembling an engineering team, and looking for an experienced project manager who can guide delivery with a balance of structure and agility, someone who can align design, engineering, and compliance into a smooth, timely execution.

If this aligned with your interests, I'd be very glad to share more details and learn more about you.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
José
