Senior Full‑Stack Engineer

Role
Own end‑to‑end features across the Web/Admin apps, Backend‑for‑Frontend (BFF), and core services. You’ll design APIs and data models, implement wallet/payments flows, integrate blockchain and ML inference, and raise the bar on reliability, security, and developer experience.

What you’ll do
- Ship product features across React/Next.js (Web/Admin), Node.js BFF, and Go services.
- Design and evolve contracts: REST/GraphQL at the edge, gRPC/events internally.
- Implement ledgered payments/withdrawals with correctness (idempotency, double‑entry).
- Integrate blockchain gateway, fiat rails, and AI risk/personalization services.
- Drive quality: tests (unit/integration/E2E), observability, SLOs, secure‑by‑default.

What you bring
- 5+ years building full‑stack products in cloud environments.
- Strength in TypeScript/React/Next.js and either Go or Node.js (willing to work in Go).
- API and data modeling depth; Postgres, Redis; Kafka/queues; event‑driven patterns.
- Solid security fundamentals (OAuth2/OIDC, JWT, RBAC/ABAC, webhooks, OWASP).
- Comfortable with Kubernetes, CI/CD, IaC; pragmatic, product‑minded, and collaborative.

Nice to have
- Payments/ledger or crypto experience (EVM, custody/MPC, HSM).
- ML in production (feature stores, online inference).
- GraphQL BFF patterns; gRPC/Protobuf; regulated fintech exposure (FCA/MiCA/MASAK).

Our stack
React/Next.js, Tailwind, Node.js (Fastify/Nest) for BFF, Go for services, REST/GraphQL, gRPC/Protobuf, Postgres, Redis, Kafka, Kubernetes + service mesh, Vault + HSM/MPC, AWS/GCP, GitHub Actions, Argo CD, Terraform/Helm, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus/Grafana, Playwright/k6.

Process
- Technical test (3–4 hours max)
- 30-min technical deep-dive via interview
- Final panel and offer
