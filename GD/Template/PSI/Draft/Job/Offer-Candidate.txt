Hi, we're building a Web3 staking platform that will integrate staking services, NFT marketplaces, and key features powered by our Metaverse game tokens and NFT assets.
To support this, we’re looking for a highly skilled and security-focused Blockchain Developer with deep expertise in Solidity, EVM-compatible chains, and smart contract architecture.
You’ll play a critical role in developing the token issuance and lifecycle management layer, as well as integrating with custodians, KYC providers, and internal APIs.
If you're passionate about secure smart contract development and excited to shape the future of Web3 gaming, apply now. Thank you.
