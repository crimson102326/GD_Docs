Hi Hamid,
Hope you are doing well.

We’re developing a Web3 staking contract platform that will integrate staking sites, NFT marketplaces, and other key features using our Metaverse game tokens and NFT assets.

To support this project, we’re looking to hire:
1-2 Blockchain Developers
1-2 Frontend Developers
1-2 Backend Developers
1 UX/UI Designer
1 DevOps Engineer
1 Project Manager
1 Technical Consultant
Additional roles as needed (e.g., Security Specialist, Data Analyst)

With a budget of around $1.5 million, we’re aiming to bring on 6-8 engineers and complete the project in 9-15 months.
Would you be able to assist with this?
If you can, message me tg: @vacuumcity
