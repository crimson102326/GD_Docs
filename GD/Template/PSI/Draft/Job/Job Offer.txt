Hi Christian, I’m Victoria, Co-founder & Head of Recruitment at OnHires, and we’re helping the ScaleIn team hire top blockchain talent. ScaleIn is a scalable, secure NFT marketplace platform serving artists, brands, and enterprises - built on Ethereum & Polygon with upgradeable, gas-optimized contracts, wallet integrations, and KYC/AML compliance.
We’re looking for experienced Web3 / Blockchain Engineers to help build their MVP. This is a remote, paid contract role with the potential to transition into a long-term position.
I’d love to learn more about your experience and see if there might be a good fit for collaboration. If you're open to it, I’d appreciate the opportunity to connect and have a quick chat.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
