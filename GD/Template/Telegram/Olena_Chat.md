1. Absolutely - we actually prefer engineers who are comfortable working across the stack. You’d have the opportunity to contribute to both frontend and backend.

2. That’s great to hear. Even with minimal Solidity experience, there’s definitely room to grow into the blockchain track - we use Solidity for smart contracts, OrbitDB for decentralized data, and IPFS. You’d be able to pick up more hands-on work over time.

# About Team
3. We currently have 7 on-site developers and 2 remote contract developers. There aren’t rigidly separated frontend/backend/blockchain teams - we work collaboratively as one group. Team meetings aren’t on a fixed cadence but are scheduled by the PM as needed.

4. We have a flexible schedule. Since we don’t have regular meetings, calls are mostly ad hoc and arranged to fit everyone’s time zones - typically just a few per week.

5. Tasks are specified via tickets/specs created by the PM. You’d collaborate closely with other developers and the PM on a daily basis.

6. We’re currently building the beta version. Our stack includes React and Vue for the frontend, Express for the backend, MongoDB and PostgreSQL for databases, Solidity for smart contracts, OrbitDB, and IPFS. This is a great time to join as you’ll be able to contribute to architecture and technology decisions while we finalize core components.

7. Right now, remote developer roles are contract-based rather than full-time - but if things go well, transitioning to full-time is definitely a discussion we’re open to having.



We have an open frontend developer role, although the salary range for this position is on the lower side. You are welcome to choose your preferred focus - either frontend development or smart contract development.

At present, all remote developer roles are contract-based rather than full-time. However, if the collaboration goes well, we are open to discussing a transition to a full-time position.

Because this project is already in progress, you can join as soon as you complete the hiring process.


Thank you for your message.

About project:
We are now developing an on-chain GameFi p2e strategy platform - an all in one solution designed to bring blockchain gaming and decentralized finance together.
To explain it briefly, It’s an RPG where players build and manage their own factions, battle for resources, and expand their territory. Every major game action (asset creation, trades, battles, upgrades) is recorded on-chain for full transparency. A dual-token system with a utility token for in-game transactions and a reward token earned through gameplay, with built-in burn mechanisms for sustainability. 
Our stack includes React and Vue for the frontend, Express for the backend, MongoDB and PostgreSQL for databases, Solidity for smart contracts, OrbitDB, and IPFS. This is a great time to join as you’ll be able to contribute to architecture and technology decisions while we finalize core components. 
The project is expected to be substantially completed by the end of this year, with a beta release planned for next year.



Hi Goel, I hope you’re having a great weekend!

We’re ready to move forward whenever you are. For the first step, we’d like to schedule a timeslot between 13:00 and 18:00 (GMT+1).
As for the coding assessment, it’s a home-based test and not overly complex. We recommend allocating around 2 to 4 hours to complete it.
Once you’ve submitted the assessment, our team lead will review it and then invite you to the technical interview, based on the results.

Looking forward to your confirmation on the schedule.
