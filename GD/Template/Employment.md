### Summary Notes:

* **Freelancers** work independently and are usually paid per project or hourly without job security.
* **Contractors** may work like employees but are technically not, and often lack long-term security.
* **Contract-to-hire** positions offer a “trial” phase before potentially becoming permanent.
* **Interns** are usually students or fresh graduates gaining experience, often paid less or unpaid.
* **Full-time** is the most stable with the most benefits.
* **Part-time** offers flexibility but fewer benefits.
