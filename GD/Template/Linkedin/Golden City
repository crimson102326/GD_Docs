# Challenging Opportunity to Revolutionize the Real Estate Industry 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi , how are you? Great connection.
Your impressive career and skills path caught me attention.
At the #Tirios, we're recently developing a new platform (GoldenCity) that will revolutionize the real estate industry and plan to strengthen the GoldenCity dev team.
Part-time or contract positions are available, and this is a completely #remote work.
Based on your profile, I'd like to invite you to join my innovative team of experts.
Want to know more? Lets have a quick chat.
------------------------------------------------
Great, this will tokenize physical properties into NFTs, allowing for fractional ownership and increased liquidity. Users will be able to invest in high-value properties without needing to purchase an entire asset.
You can check out the requirements for this project here and if you are employed, part-time or contract work is also available, as well as working remotely. 
Let me know what you think about our idea and your related experiences.
------------------------------------------------
Let me give you a quick overview of the roadmap + team structure so you have a clearer picture:
We’re funded and have a dedicated budget allocated (happy to walk you through the breakdown).
Dev team includes a CTO, Tech Lead, blockchain dev, frontend dev, backend dev, and dedicated infra, QA, and UI/UX.
Timeline: MVP in 3 months → full platform rollout in 8–10 months.
------------------------------------------------
There’s a lot of room for you to influence architecture decisions, especially around staking, cross-chain events, and NFT marketplace logic.
Budget-wise, we're looking at $10K–15K/month, depending on scope and level of involvement.
------------------------------------------------
Initial tech interview with test - with our technical manager to dive into your architecture thinking, code style, and problem-solving.
Final call with CTO - mostly to align on culture, goals, and expectations.
Offer + onboarding - if all goes well, we start fast.
------------------------------------------------
Good, I'd like to have a short meeting to discuss this in more detail. In the meeting, my HR member will discuss you detailed information about your role, and salary, and will conduct a simple test on the main stack. As you may know, many people on LinkedIn have strong reviews and backgrounds, so we believe a meeting is a direct and effective way to demonstrate a candidate's abilities. 
Let me know when you are available for the meeting this week.
------------------------------------------------
Sounds good, schedule the meeting here 
https://calendly.com/hiring-trilog99ai
------------------------------------------------
I'll share the simple test item 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uoPfZTkZNVTpp0vytAubw2lWjSRccJ7X5x-gCF7d_OA
Once you have completed it, send me the recorded video before the meeting and prepare your feedback.
------------------------------------------------
In the meantime, review the landing page and main logic of current project and prepare your feedback for the meeting.
Here is the latest demo version of the project developed by the previous team, where you can check the tech stack, landing page and current status.
