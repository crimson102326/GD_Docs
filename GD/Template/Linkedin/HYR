Hey Nitesh, Hope you are doing well.

We’re developing a Web3 staking contract platform that will integrate staking sites, NFT marketplaces, and other key features using our Metaverse game tokens and NFT assets.

To support this project, we’re looking to hire:
- 1-2 Blockchain Developers
- 1-2 Frontend Developers
- 1-2 Backend Developers
- 1 UX/UI Designer
- 1 DevOps Engineer
- 1 Data Engineer
- 1 Technical Consultant
Additional roles as needed (e.g., Security Specialist, QA Tester)

With a budget of around $2.2 million-$2.5 million, we’re aiming to bring on 6-8 engineers and complete the project in 9-15 months. 

Would you be able to assist with this?

Hi Nitesh, thanks for reaching out.

first of all, let me briefly share some details about our project.

As I mentioned, we’re currently looking to develop a staking contract Web3 platform that integrates staking sites, NFT marketplaces, and other key features, all powered by our Metaverse Game tokens and NFT assets.

Initially, we hired a team to help with our project, but unfortunately, their coding skills didn’t meet our expectations. As a result, we are seeking a more experienced team to take over and lead the development of this project.

Here’s a brief overview of our requirements

We need to expand the project across multiple chains.

While the basic staking logic is in place, further work is needed to complete the customer profile, NFT marketplace, and Staking logic.
We also need to implement the mobile design.

There are several modifications required to align the platform with our evolving vision.

An important aspect to consider is the animation on the landing page. This is crucial because the landing page is the first thing users see when they visit the site. While there is currently an animation, feedback from visual experts and developers suggests that it would be better to remove it. The animation is too tiring on the eyes, and removing it could improve the overall user experience by creating a cleaner design.

I’m excited about the direction we’re heading, and I believe this project has potential.
--------------------------------------------------

I think you'd be a great fit for our project as a Full-Stack Engineer.
Would you be available for a meeting with our Tech Manager this week to discuss the project in more detail?
Let me share his calendar link with you, Does that work for you?

I would love to help you with the product.

Thanks Nitech, please book a time that works best for you using our tech manager's Calendly link:

In the meantime, could you please review the landing page and main logic of current project and prepare your feedback for the meeting?
Here is the latest demo version of the project developed by the previous team, where you can check the tech stack, landing page and staking logic.
