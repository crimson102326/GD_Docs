Thank you for sharing your resume. 

After reviewing your profile, I'm impressed with your experience in backend development, as well as your expertise in Web3 and blockchain - those are definitely valuable skills for this project.

To get a better sense of how we can move forward, I’d appreciate it if you could answer the following questions:

- Do you have experience working in remote, international teams?
- Which technical areas do you feel strongest in (blockchain, frontend, backend, AI/ML, DevOps, etc.)?

Feel free to elaborate on any points or provide additional information that might be relevant to the project. I’m looking forward to your response.


Thank you for your sharing.

Hiring process:

✔Initial tech interview with test - with our technical manager to dive into your architecture thinking, code style, and problem-solving.
✔Final call with CTO - mostly to align on culture, goals, and expectations.

Sounds good. 

I would like to have a meeting to discuss in more detail. During the meeting, the HR person will provide detailed information about the position and salary of the employee in question, and a simple test will be conducted on the main stack. 

As you know, LinkedIn has many people with good reviews and careers, so I think this meeting will be a direct and effective way to demonstrate the candidate's capabilities.

The test will be conducted in two ways, depending on the candidate's convenience:
- Live coding test during the meeting
- Home test with demo project
Please select the test you want and let me know when you are available for the meeting this week.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Your choice of testing method will not affect our assessment of your skills, and we will respect your choice.

Please check the test requirement and and complete the one of them.
https://gitlab.com/real-world-assest-tokenization/goldencity/-/blob/main/test-requirement.md

After that please submit the result, schedule the meeting with the technical manager 2 days after submission.

Hello, Vivian. How's your weekend?

Our company is not a professional software development firm.

We started this project for two main reasons:

First, as industrial activity increases and environmental pollution continues to be ignored, our planet is being destroyed. We want to do something meaningful to address this issue.

Second, blockchain technology and rwa are growing rapidly, and we believe this trend will transform industries and create new opportunities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We started about two months ago and are aiming to complete the MVP version by the end of this year. We’re now focusing on strengthening our development capabilities across each area.

I’d like to share our latest demo so you can take a look:

If you know anyone with experience in these fields, please feel free to recommend them - I’d really appreciate it.

``` Answer for NFTs are bursted ```

Hi Nikola,

Totally fair question - we’re aware that most NFT projects from the last cycle failed because they were purely speculative.

What we’re doing is different: the NFTs in GoldenCity aren’t collectibles or art pieces, but digital representations of verified property shares. Each token is linked to a real, legally registered asset and smart contracts handle ownership fractions, staking, and transfer rights.

Think of it less like a “timeshare” and more like a digitized share registry for property. The blockchain layer mainly provides transparency, traceability, and simplified secondary trading - not hype.

This project's been started 2 months and we are planning to complete mvp version by the end of year. 

By the way, as personally, I'm really impress your honest and professional answer in trend. I hope we could move forward and I'd like you to participate to this project as a Project Manager.




Hello .

Thank you for your kind and honest message. 

You might be busy with your own business and may not have much time for the external one but I am sure that it is great opportunity for you.
