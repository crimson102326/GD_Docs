Thank you for sharing. 

I would like to evaluate your candidacies more detailed during the hiring process. 

As you can see in job description, the first step is the test assignment,

The test assignment is a simple test - it won't take an hour but need attention to detail. Candidates who pass the test will have the opportunity to move forward in the process, and their profiles will be saved in our database for future opportunities.

Even if you're not currently available for the position, a strong test submission may lead to regular updates about relevant openings in the future.

We have sent an invitation to your github to share the test requirements. Please check the readme file and let me know how much time do you need to complete.
------------------------------------------------------
Hello, Enrique. How are you doing today?

We've sent an invitation to your github to share the test requirement.

You can find the requirements and the instructions in the readme file. 

If you have any question, feel free to message me anytime.
-----------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your effort on the coding assessment. 

I will submit the result to the technical team and they will review it. 

After that, I will update you.

Have a nice day
--------------------------------------
That being said, we really appreciate the effort you put into the test assessment, but unfortunately, you were eliminated in the first stage.

We’d love to stay in touch for future roles that might be a better fit for your skills.
 
Thanks again for your time, and I look forward to keeping the door open for potential future collaborations!
--------------------------------------------------








You have two options for the test assignment:
Complete a brief take-home test (approximately one hour) and submit it to us. We’ll review it as soon as possible and, if all goes well, proceed to the next interview stage.
Join a meeting directly where you can showcase your skills in real time, if you prefer live coding.
During this session, you’ll learn more about our team and the company, answer a few technical questions, and then complete a coding test.
We’ve decided to move forward with another candidate at this time.

I’m sorry to share this news, but I’ll be sure to reach out if any new opportunities arise that may be a good fit for you.
If you know anyone else with strong experience in backend development within the Web3 space, I’d appreciate any recommendations.
We prefer to avoid unnecessary meetings, and most of our communication will take place via chat.
Do you have any difficulty understanding documentation or writing in English?
We welcome talented developers from around the globe - this position has no location requirements.
