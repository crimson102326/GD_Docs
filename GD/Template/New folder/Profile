28 years old, 5 of which I’ve spent creating successful products in the e-commerce, B2B SaaS, and FinTech sectors. I’ve worked on projects from scratch to launch, led a team of designers, and conducted numerous research studies. I enjoy working on complex processes and tight systems. I am fluent in
English, dive confidently into new fields, and strive for perfection in my work. I stay ahead of trends, rather than trying to follow them.

Hi, my name is Robbe and I am a software developer from Belgium, interested in blockchain, backend applications and DevOps. 
I started my journey mainly focused on blockchain and the further I dove in this topic, the more I got interested in backend development and Devops. With my experience I learned how these three topics go together like mayo with fries (Yes, I'm truly a Belgian 😉). I love the magic behind the curtain!
