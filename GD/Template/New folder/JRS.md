Thank you for your reply.

Let me briefly share some details about the project.

Here’s a brief overview of project:
https://www.notion.so/P12-GameFi-Ecosystem-Infinity-Force-Platform-25f9f7a2e4458086a5d6ee20999e9222

When are you available for a meeting with manager to discuss about the project, experience, role and proposal in detail?
---------------------------------------------------
Good. Our Joining Process:
1. Feedback step about MVP Platform
2. Interview with manager, focusing on discussing about project, relevant experience, role and proposal
3. Technical Interview

Firstly, please schedule your interview with manager using following link:
https://calendly.com/technical-interview-with-tom-gleeson 

After done, please let me know.
-----------------------------------------------
Thank you for your scheduling. I have confirmed it.

Here is the latest demo version of the project, developed by previous team, where you can check platform:

https://gitlab.com/0xtechlead/gamefi-ecosystem-platform-latest-demo

After completing your exploration of the platform, please share your short feedback based on the points below:

- How do you evaluate the overall user experience and interface(UI/UX) for both users and developers?
- What are your thoughts on the main dashboard and key platform features?
- How well do you think the integration systems (e.g., Steam login, authentication, and API connections) are designed and functioning?
- What’s your impression of the NFT minting process, rarity logic, and overall Web3 experience? (Optional)
- From your area of expertise, what improvements or ideas would you suggest to enhance the platform further?

It will take about 15 mins.

Please submit your feedback result as soon as possible for review.

* If you can not submit in time, we should reschedule interview.

Looking forward to your update soon

Best,

Will it be okay to reschedule the meeting for the same time tomorrow?

 I am currently in the middle of some tasks, and I may not be able to deliver the answers early enough.

Will do.


Thanks for sharing the GitLab repo. Could you please confirm if there’s a hosted demo or specific branch I should check out for the MVP preview?

Hi Pauline, is there a chance for me to get a hosted MVP demo?

Running it locally hasn't been quite successful for me.

Even though I was finally only able to access a few screens from the demo, here are my answers to your questions:


1. How do you evaluate the overall user experience and interface (UI/UX) for both users and developers?

The overall experience feels strong and purposeful. P12 looks and behaves like a platform made for gamers, not just a blockchain project. The visuals, energy, and flow all capture that gaming vibe.

For new users, though, the experience could be easier to grasp. The dashboard shows a lot of data at once, which can be confusing without context. Adding short guides, tooltips, or an intro walkthrough would make it much easier to follow.

For developers, I think a dedicated dashboard that shows their engagement data, contributions, and rewards in real time would make the experience more rewarding.

2. What are your thoughts on the main dashboard and key platform features?

The dashboard looks great and gives a real sense of progress and competition. The leaderboards and badges keep users engaged.

That said, it feels a bit heavy at first glance. There’s a lot of information fighting for attention. Simplifying the layout or introducing features gradually could help users focus and enjoy exploring the platform without feeling overwhelmed.

3. How well do you think the integration systems (Steam login, authentication, and API connections) are designed and functioning?

The Steam connection works well and instantly adds credibility. The main challenge is that connecting Steam and the wallet feels like two separate actions.

It would be better if both were merged into one continuous flow. Imagine pressing “Enter the P12 Universe” and having it connect your Steam account, then smoothly move into wallet verification. That would make onboarding feel natural and effortless.

4. What’s your impression of the NFT minting process, rarity logic, and overall Web3 experience? (Optional)

The soul-bound NFT concept is brilliant. It gives every player a sense of identity and achievement.

Still, the minting process could feel more rewarding. Instead of it being a technical step, it could happen right after verification so players see their first NFT appear instantly. Turning it into a moment of celebration would make the experience more exciting and personal.

5. From your area of expertise, what improvements or ideas would you suggest to enhance the platform further?

I’d focus on three things:

Combine Steam and wallet sign-ins into one smooth process.

Add clear feedback at every step so users always know what’s happening.

Gradually reveal complex data to keep the interface clean and approachable.

These small UX changes would make the platform simpler, more engaging, and much more memorable for both gamers and developers.
