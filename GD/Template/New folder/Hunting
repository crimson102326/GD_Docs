Hi,
I am Jinming from Hong Kong and looking for someone to earn with me.
First of all, I am not a scammer so please be calm and read my offer carefully.
I believe it will help both of us.
I am an automation engineer who graduated from college and worked for several companies for about 8 years.
But last year I had to quit my job due to personal reasons and I could never work for a company again due to physical problems.
So I decided to work from home and my old colleagues advised me to work on freelance platforms like Upwork and Fiverr.
I worked as a freelancer during my college days to earn extra income.
But I felt some tragic things while working as a freelancer.

Most of clients preferred to work with European or American developers.
Since I am an Asian national, it was really hard for me to get new projects.
So this time I decided to use an account of a European or American to increase my income.
I worked with an Iranian developer in my previous company and he suggested this idea to me.
He said that his country is blocked on many platforms on the internet and he used an account of a British person before working for a company in the past. I thought it would work for me too and decided to find someone who could collaborate with me.
Of course, I will share the profits with you.
Your role is only to provide your nationality to the account, and my role is to receive and complete projects to earn money.
Once the account grows, it will not be difficult to receive new projects and our income will increase as quickly as possible.
This is a remote collaboration and I prefer to work with honest and trustworthy people. And I should use your account in your pc with a remote application.
I do not want to be scammed anymore, so we can share our IDs, passports or have video conferences to verify each other.

I am confident in my abilities and sincerely look forward to your help.

Saying what I want directly is that I want you to lend your upwork and freelancer account that I can earn extra income. I will share the benefit every month with you. And as you know at the first three month, we should nourish the account, so there may be not enough income during this time. Even if there isn't any income, I will pay at least 50$ every month. After that I will pay 10% of my income for your account. 

For example, id verify, ip detection, contact ouside of the platform, and so on. in that platforms, support team always monitors memeber's action and If they violate the terms of service even a little bit, they will be stopped without mercy.
